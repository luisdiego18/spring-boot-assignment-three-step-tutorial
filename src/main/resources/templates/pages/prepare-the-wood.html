<h1>Step 1: Prepare the Wood</h1>
<br>

<p>Make sure the wood is ready to stain by first sanding it lightly in the direction of the grain with a medium grit sandpaper, followed by one with a fine grit. Tip: If the wood is soft or porous, then after sanding, use a pre-stain wood conditioner to prevent blotching. If you are using a water-based stain, be sure to use a pre-stain wood conditioner, regardless of wood species.</p>
